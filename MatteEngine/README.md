# MatteEngine

A C++/SDL 2D game engine in development by Stephen Hara (@tarsir).

## Motivation
 
I mostly wanted more practice with C++ and game tool development in
general, especially modern C++ (C\++11 and C++14). I also hadn't any
experience fully building out an entity-component-system architecture,
just using it as inspiration in other projects, and I wanted to do more
of that.

## Desired Features

* Map/level editor
* Scripting
* An actual GUI for creating games
* So many!
